## About LIRI: 
  LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

 ## How does LIRI work? 
 Users will need to go through their terminal/bash window and choose from specific requests in order to receive data displayed in their terminal as well as logged into `log.txt` file.
 
 ### List of Possible Requests: 
 * `my-tweets` - This request will return your past 20 tweets. 
 * `spotify-this-song <song-title>` - This request will return information about the `<song-title>` you have entered. Warning: if you do not pick a song, I will pick one for you.
 * `movie-this <movie-title>` - This request will return information about the `<movie-title>` you have entered. Again as a Warning: if you do not pick a movie, I will pick one for you.
 * `do-what-it-says` - This request will return information from commands in `random.txt`. As of right now, `random.txt` only has one command, and the program is coded specificaly for this one command.
